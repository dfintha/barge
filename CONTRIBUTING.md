# Contributing to `barge`

Since `barge` is a personal project, no external contributions are expected. If
one intends to contribute improvements to the source code, they can do so by
forking the repository and creating a pull request. Note that not all pull
requests will be merged into the `master` branch, but any construction
contribution is welcome.
