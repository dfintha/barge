# barge

## Overview

`barge` is a very simple tool written in Rust, which manages building projects,
which contain Assembly, C, and C++ source files, with its main goal being
simplicity.

Each project translates to a single library (static or shared) or executable.
Projects have and `src` and an `include` directory at their root. which contain
the source and header files respectively. Subdirectories within these
directories are supported.

Source and header files shall have appropriate file extensions based on their
type: `.c` for C source files, `.cpp` for C++ source files, `.s` for Assembly
source files, `.h` for C header files, and `.hpp` for C++ header files.

**Please note that the development of this software is in a very early stage.
As such, changes to the project file format and/or usage can happen
frequently.**

## Requirements

Internally, `barge` uses the following external software, which are required
for proper functionality.

- `coreutils (cat, wc)`: Used internally to count source code lines.
- `findutils (find)`: Used internally to collect project files.
- `make`: Used internally to perform various tasks on the project.
- `nasm`: Used to compile Assembly source files.
- `clang (clang, clang++, clang-tidy, clang-format)`: Used to compile C/C++
  source files, to link the executable, to run static analysis on the code, and
  to automatically format the code.
- `git`: Used to initialize a `git`Ë™repository on project creation.

On Arch Linux, the following command installs the packages of all the required
dependencies.

`pacman -S coreutils findutils make nasm clang git`

## Subcommands

`barge` supports the following subcommands.

- `init <NAME>`: Creates a new project with a simple `"Hello, world!"` program
  in C++, and initializes a `git` repository in a directory with the same name.
- `build [TARGET]`, `b`: Builds the project executable for the given build
  target.
  Since this process uses GNU `make` internally, some messages may be displayed
  by its execution.
- `clean`: Deletes the build artifacts of the project (the built executable and
  the object files).
- `rebuild [TARGET]`: Equivalent to subsequently invoking `clean` and `build`.
- `run [TARGET]`, `r`: Builds and executes the project executable.
- `lines`: Displays the amount of lines of source code for the whole project.
- `analyze`: Performs static analysis for the C/C++ source files in the project.
- `format`, `fmt` : Formats the source files in-place using `clang-format`.

The `build`, `rebuild`, and `run` subcommands have an optional argument, which
represents the configuration (target) of the build. The currently supported
targets are `debug` and `release`. If none is specified, `debug` is selected by
default.

In `debug` configuration, the resulting file contains its debug symbols, and is
optimized for debugging, while in `release` configuration, the symbols are
stripped, and the file is optimized for fast execution.

## The project file

The user can specify the settings to their project by changing `barge.json` at
the project root. This file contains a single configuration object with the
following fields.

- **name (string)**:
  The name of the project.
- **project_type (string)**:
  The type of the project. Can be either `binary`, `shared_library`, or `static_library`.
- **version (string)**:
  The version of the project.
- **c_standard (string)**:
  The C standard used for the C source files, in a format like "c99".
- **cpp_standard (string)**:
  The C++ standard used for the C source files, in a format like "c++14".
- **external_libraries (list of objects, optional)**:
  The list of external libraries to link with. This is a list of objects, which
  are represented in one of the following ways.
  - Using pkg-config: { type: "pkg_config", name: "LIBRARY_NAME" }
  - Manually specifying flags: { type: "manual", "cflags": "LIBRARY_CFLAGS", ldflags: "LIBRARY_LDFLAGS"}
- **custom_cflags (string, optional)**:
  Adds the flags specified here to the C source file compilation command line.
- **custom_cxxflags (string, optional)**:
  Adds the flags specified here to the C++ source file compilation command line.
- **custom_ldflags (string, optional)**:
  Adds the flags specified here to the executable linking command line.
- **custom_makeopts (string, optional)**:
  Adds the flags specified here to the GNU make command line. If none given, the default makeopts
  will only specify the amount of parallel jobs. This is the minimum of the logical cores and the
  amount of free memory divided by 2 GiB.
- **format_style (string, optional)**:
  The style in which clang-format formats the project sources. If none given, the default is Google.
  The supported format styles are the ones supported by `clang-format`. If `file` is given,
  `clang-format` will look for a `.clang-format` file in parent directories relative to the given
  source file.

### Specific project file, which contains all the optional fields

```json
{
    "name": "example",
    "project_type": "binary",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "c_standard": "c99",
    "cpp_standard": "c++14",
    "external_libraries": [
        {
            "type": "pkg_config",
            "name": "sdl"
        },
        {
            "type": "manual",
            "cflags": "",
            "ldflags": "-lpthread"
        }
    ],
    "custom_cflags": "-DNDEBUG",
    "custom_cxxflags": "-DNDEBUG",
    "custom_ldflags": "-ggdb",
    "custom_makeopts": "-j2",
    "format_style": "Google"
}
```

### Minimal project file, which contains no optional fields

```json
{
    "name": "example",
    "project_type": "binary",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "c_standard": "c99",
    "cpp_standard": "c++14"
}
```
